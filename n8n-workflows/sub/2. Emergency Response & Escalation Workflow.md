Implementation Notes
- ROI Calculation Workflow:
- Triggered by scheduled checks or API requests
- Analyzes lead profiles and enriches incomplete data
- Searches properties using RAG (vector database)
- Calculates multiple ROI scenarios in parallel
- Uses AI to generate personalized recommendations
- Creates tailored reports based on lead temperature
- Delivers via multiple channels with tracking
- Emergency Response Workflow:
- Receives alerts via webhook from any system component
- Categorizes errors by type and severity
- Routes to appropriate response handlers
- Implements circuit breaker patterns for system resilience
- Sends parallel notifications to relevant teams
- Executes automatic recovery actions
- Creates audit trails and incident records
- Performs post-mortem analysis after resolution
- Both workflows are production-ready and can be imported directly into N8N. They include error handling, retry logic, and comprehensive monitoring integration.
